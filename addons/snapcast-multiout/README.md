### Finding Audio Devices

1. Enable `list_devices_on_start: true`
2. Connect your USB audio interface(s)
3. Start the add-on
4. Check the logs to see available devices:

```
----- ALSA PCMs (playback) -----
hw:CARD=Creative,DEV=0
    Creative Sound Blaster, USB Audio
hw:CARD=UMC1820,DEV=0  
    Behringer UMC1820, USB Audio
hw:CARD=UMC1820,DEV=1
    Behringer UMC1820, USB Audio #1
```

5. Use the device names in your configuration (e.g., `hw:UMC1820,0` or `hw:1,0`)

### Stereo Audio Verification

Each configured stream should output **stereo audio**:
- Left channel audio ‚Üí Left speaker in room
- Right channel audio ‚Üí Right speaker in room
- Perfect synchronization across all rooms when grouped

If you hear mono audio or only one channel, check:
- ALSA device configuration
- Cable connections to amplifiers
- Source audio format (ensure stereo input)

## Usage

1. **Configure your streams** in the add-on configuration
2. **Start the add-on** - it will create one Snapclient per configured stream
3. **Access the web interface** at `http://your-home-assistant:1780`
4. **Use with Music Assistant** or other media players that support Snapcast

## Network Ports

The add-on uses these ports:
- **1704**: Snapcast audio streaming
- **1705**: Snapcast control protocol  
- **1780**: Web interface

## Integration with Music Assistant

This add-on works perfectly with Music Assistant:

1. Install and configure Music Assistant
2. Add Snapcast streams as playback targets
3. Group streams together for multi-room playback
4. Control everything through Home Assistant dashboards
